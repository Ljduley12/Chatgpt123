# Chat Interface

This is a simple chat interface that allows users to interact by sending messages and receiving responses. It can be customized to handle specific questions and provide appropriate answers.

## Getting Started

To run the chat interface locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:


2. Open the project directory:



3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

4. Start interacting with the chat interface by typing messages into the input field.

## Usage

The chat interface allows users to send messages by typing in the input field and pressing Enter. The interface will display the user's message and provide a response based on the implemented logic in the JavaScript code.

You can customize the behavior of the chat interface by modifying the `getAnswer()` function in the `script.js` file. This function checks the user's message and returns an appropriate answer.

## Deployment

The chat interface can be deployed to various hosting platforms. Here are some examples:

- **Render.com**: Create a new web service and upload the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Configure the service to use a static site and deploy it.

- **Glitch.com**: Create a new Glitch project and import the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Glitch.com will automatically deploy your project.

- **Netlify**: Set up a new site from Git, connect your Git repository, and deploy your site.

Please refer to the respective hosting platforms' documentation for detailed instructions on deploying static websites.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to suit your specific needs. You can modify the appearance of the chat interface by updating the CSS styles in the `styles.css` file. Additionally, you can enhance the logic of the chatbot by expanding the `getAnswer()` function in the `script.js` file.
